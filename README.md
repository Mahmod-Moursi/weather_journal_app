## What did we learned

- In this project, we set up a Node environment with Express and the necessary project dependencies.
- In this project, we set up a server with GET and POST routes.
- In this project, we created developer credentials for a Web API.
- In this project, we used the Fetch API with the credentials and user input to get dynamic data into the app routes.
- In this project, we accessed a GET route on the server side, from a function called on the client side.
- In this project, we chained Promises together.
- In this project, we accessed HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamically.

## Updates and future changes

- The background would change to a picture reflecting the temperature of the area chosen.
- Show previous entries in a 'History' section.
- Give the option to choose celsius or fahrenheit as a temperature unit.
